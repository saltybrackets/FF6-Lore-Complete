For completeness and contiguity, information on the battleevent bits has been included in this writing. An event bit, in essence,provides information indicating whether a requirement of a conditional-branchinstruction has been satisfied. Put succinctly, it acts as a switch.Interestingly, there are approximately 140 unused event bits, which can beincorporated into hacking projects. One should nevertheless be cautious aboutthe bits labelled as such. Since neither the event code nor the assembly codehas ever been portrayed as accurately as can be, it is practically impossibleto ascertain which bits are really unused, hence the regular inclusion of aquestion mark in the list.Please note that certain functions that involve an event bit are not executedon the world map. For instance, a bit that is supposed to be cleared on eachstep taken by a party will not be cleared on such a map. Likewise, the bit thatdisables menu access will have no effect. Further note that the event bits arestored in 96 bytes of RAM from address $1E80 to $1EDF in bank $7E.I recommend that this document be used in conjunction with an event dumpproduced from Yousei's Event Disassembler, as they complement each othernicely. The most recent disassembly can be found on the site of Imzogelmo:http://www.angelfire.com/al2/imzogelmo/patches.html###############################################################################                                  EVENT BITS###############################################################################Bit RAM  Description-------------------------------------------------------------------------------000 80:0 Unused?001 80:1 Met Arvis (disables a Magitek Armor-related function in the mines)002 80:2 Unused?003 80:3 Initiated the tripartite battle with the Moogles (pointless?)004 80:4 Named Edgar (affects Figaro Castle and Narshe)005 80:5 Named Sabin006 80:6 Met Kefka in Figaro Castle007 80:7 Saw Sabin say he has to wander around Figaro Castle for a while008 81:0 Locke is inside the library of Figaro Castle009 81:1 Unused?00A 81:2 Saw Shadow heading toward the café00B 81:3 Named Shadow00C 81:4 Unused?00D 81:5 Saw shadowy "Vargas" 100E 81:6 Saw shadowy "Vargas" 200F 81:7 Saw shadowy "Vargas" 3010 82:0 Defeated Vargas (affects South Figaro and Sabin's cabin)011 82:1 Met Banon012 82:2 Awakening plays in the Returners' Hideout; can find the scrap of paper013 82:3 Accepted Banon's offer (useless?)014 82:4 Declined Banon's offer 1015 82:5 Declined Banon's offer 2016 82:6 Declined Banon's offer 3 (useless?)017 82:7 Got either Gauntlet or Genji Glove018 83:0 Banon joined the party019 83:1 Boarded the raft (affects Narshe and Lete River)01A 83:2 Fought Ultros at Lete River (affects various locations)01B 83:3 Celes asked Locke why he was helping her01C 83:4 Named Celes01D 83:5 Freed Celes01E 83:6 Completed Locke's scenario01F 83:7 Banon and the others were denied entry to Narshe020 84:0 Discovered how to open the secret entrance in Narshe021 84:1 Completed Terra's scenario022 84:2 Saw the scene involving the stove of Gau's father023 84:3 Unused?024 84:4 Saw Shadow's dream 1025 84:5 Unused?

A large share of the credit belongs tothose, including myself, who have contributed to Yousei's program over theyears.Thanks to Imzogelmo for his documents on event triggers, map event pointers,and non-player characters, as they accelerated the process and reduced the riskof errors. I also want to offer a word of thanks for the feedback during thepreliminary phase.My acknowledgements to erokky for proofreading some of the descriptions.Thanks to Geiger for his wonderful Snes9X debugger. Without a tool of thatnature and caliber, compiling such a list would have proven fairly difficult.Lastly, I would like to thank those who dedicated themselves to generating orsupplementing a commented disassembly of one of the many banks in the game.###############################################################################                                VERSION HISTORY###############################################################################Version 1.03 (June 17, 2013):  Replaced the description for bit 1CF.  Refined the description for bit 1DD1:6.  Replaced numerous descriptions for variable 1EBC.  Reworded certain passages.Version 1.02 (June 10, 2011):  Refined the descriptions for bits 1DD0:0, 1DD1:3, 1DD1:5, and 1DD1:6.  Replaced numerous descriptions for variable 1DCF.  Replaced the descriptions for bits 1C6 and 2FF.  Reworded certain passages.Version 1.01 (December 17, 2009):  Corrected an inconsequential inversion in the descriptions of unused bits.  Added notes concerning rare items in the Game Boy Advance editions.  Replaced the description for bit 279.  Reworded certain passages.###############################################################################                               LEGAL DISCLAIMER###############################################################################The contents of this document cannot be reproduced without the written consentof the author, unless for personal purposes.
