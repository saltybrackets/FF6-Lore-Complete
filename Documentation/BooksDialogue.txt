"Empire Soldier Rankings" (Narshe, School, Adv. Battle Tactics)
Soldiers in the largest wing of the 
Empire's army can be broken down 
into five ranks, each distinguished 
by their armor color.<EOP>
Cadets are the lowest rank, wearing 
green armor and performing the most 
menial duties.<EOP>
Brown-armored soldiers, the largest 
portion of the Empire's forces, 
contain Soldiers, Commanders, 
Corporals, and Sergeants.<EOP>
Field Commanders wear black armor, 
and lead troops in combat. Should a 
field commander fall in battle with 
none to replace them, forces will be 
forced to call a retreat.<EOP>
Orange-armored soldiers are under the 
direct command of Kefka Palazzo, and 
are all expertly trained in the 
piloting of Magitek Armor.<EOP>
The highest rank, wearing custom
armor, is the Imperial Elite. 
They are subdivided into Officers, 
Captains, Generals, and Templars.

"Elder's Journal" (Narshe)
20 years ago, Narshe placed a ban 
on coal exports to the invading 
Gestahlian Empire through armed 
resistance.<EOP>
While a pact for mutual peace was 
agreed upon, I can't help but 
wonder what their next steps will 
be.<EOP>
The recent excavation of the 
frozen esper only complicates 
things. How long before the pact 
is broken?
