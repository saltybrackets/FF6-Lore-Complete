# FF6-Lore-Complete
Final Fantasy VI ROM hack that attempts to inject additional (canon) lore into the game.

I've put this up mostly for educational purposes (specifically, an example of using the [SNES ROM Editing](https://github.com/saltycog/SNES-ROM-Editing) library), as you likely won't be able to get it to work with whatever stock FF6 ROM you obtain -- the one I'm modifying has additional edits and expansions applied to it, and I cannot provide that ROM here for obvious legal reasons.

If you do wish to clone this repository, note that it utilizes a submodule pointing to the [SNES ROM Editing](https://github.com/saltycog/SNES-ROM-Editing) library, so you'll want to clone recursively.
