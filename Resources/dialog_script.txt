Biggs: There's the city_<D24><EOP>
Wedge: Hard to believe an Esper's been found intact there, a thousand years after the War of the Magi_<D24>

[caption #1]
Biggs: Think it's still alive?
Wedge: Probably_
_judging from the urgency of our orders. <D24><EOP>
Plus, they had us bring this sorceress with us.<D24>

[caption #2]
Biggs: Yeah_our witch. Why's she here? <D24><EOP>
I heard she fried 50 of our Magitek Armored soldiers in under 3 minutes. Kind of makes your skin crawl_<D24>

[caption #3]
Wedge: Relax. The Slave Crown on her head makes her a mindless puppet. She'll follow orders.<D24>

[caption #4]
Wedge: We'll approach from the east.
Move out!<D12>

[caption #5]
   Long ago, the War of the Magi
       reduced the world to a
  scorched wasteland, and magic
       simply ceased to exist. <E$FF><OP$12>

[caption #6]
  1000 years have passed_ Iron,
  gunpowder, and steam engines
    have been developed, and
     high technology reigns_ <E$FF><OP$12>

[caption #7]
    But now there are some who
    would enslave the world by
  reviving the dreaded destructive
      force known as [magic.] <E$FF><OP$12>

[caption #8]
          Can it be that those
    in power are on the verge of
         repeating a senseless
          and deadly mistake? <E$2A><OP$12>

[caption #9]
An eerie glow surrounds you.<EOP>
Want info about Save Points?

[caption #10]
Wedge: Let's put her on point.
No sense taking any risks.
Forward!

[caption #11]
Wedge: The Esper must be in here.
Move out!

[caption #12]
Guard: Imperial Magitek Armor?
Not even Narshe's safe anymore!

[caption #13]
Guard: Imperial machine-riding, self-important swine! You have no business here! Take this!

[caption #14]
Guard: Narshe's freedom depends on us!

[caption #15]
Wedge: According to our source, the frozen Esper was found in a new mine shaft.
_Maybe this one_

[caption #16]
Biggs: I'll handle this.
Stand back!

[caption #17]
Guard: We've got 'em trapped, now!

[caption #18]
Guard: We must defend the mines!

[caption #19]
Locked.

[caption #20]
Girl: Where am I_?

[caption #21]
Old Man: Whoa! You're awake!
And I only just removed the crown!
<EOP>
Girl: Ow_head_hurts_

[caption #22]
Old Man: Easy now! This is a Slave Crown. The others had complete control over you while you were wearing it.

[caption #23]
Girl: I can't remember a thing_<EOP>
Old Man: Don't worry.
It'll all come back to you_in time, that is.<EOP>

Old Man: Impressive!
I've never heard of anyone recovering this fast_!

[caption #25]
Guard: Open up! Give us the Empire's Magitek Armor pilot!

[caption #26]
Guard: Open this door!
We want that girl!
She's an agent of the Empire!

[caption #27]
<A0>: Empire_?
Magitek Armor_?

[caption #28]
Old Man: Look, I have to get you out of here! I don't have time to explain!

[caption #29]
Old Man: Over here!

[caption #30]
A mysterious young woman, enslaved by the Gesthalian Empire, and born with the gift of magic__

Old Man: Make your way out through the mines! I'll keep these brutes occupied!

[caption #33]
There she is!

[caption #34]
She's up there!

[caption #35]
Kefka: My sweet little magic user_! Uweee, he, he! With this Slave Crown I'll practically OWN you!!

[caption #36]
<A0>: No! Get away from me!

[caption #37]
Gestahl: Soldiers of the Empire! We stand at the dawn of a new age! The lost power of magic has returned to us!<EOP>
Gestahl: It is our destiny, and ours alone, to take this mystic force and claim what is rightfully ours!

[caption #38]
Cid: This is my finest work.
These Magitek Converters combine the power of magic with machines_

[caption #39]
Gestahl: We will conquer the world with our new-found power! Nothing can stand in our way!<EOP>
Hurrah!!!
Long live Emperor Gestahl!!!

[caption #40]
Old Man: Took you long enough!
How goes the robbing and plundering trade?

[caption #41]
<A1>: I PREFER the term treasure hunting!<EOP>
Old Man: Ha! Like there's a difference_<EOP>
<A1>: There's a HUGE difference!

[caption #42]
<A1>: Anyway, is there something you need me to do?<EOP>
Old Man: Yeah. I've met the girl.

[caption #43]
<A1>: __!? You don't mean?

[caption #44]
Old Man: The city's guards are pursuing her even as we speak.<EOP>
This city has the strength to stand up to the Empire but won't use it.<EOP>
Even so, it's not like it will join forces with an underground resistance movement, like
the Returners.<EOP>
I tried to explain that the Empire enslaved the girl but they won't listen!

[caption #45]
<A1>: All right_
I think we'd better help getting her out of Narshe_

[caption #46]
Old Man: Agreed. Take her to Figaro Castle, and talk to the king.

[caption #47]
Treasure hunter and trail-worn traveler, searching the world over for relics of the past_

You'll fight using 3 different groups. Press the Y Button to switch between them.<EOP>
Your job is to defeat the commander of the guards before his men reach <A0>. Save her, or else_

[caption #55]
<A0>: Unh_

[caption #56]
<A1>: Thanks, Moogles!
We're in your debt!

<A1>: Give it time. You're safe with me! I give you my word!
<A0>: _?<EOP>
<A1>: I won't leave your side until your memory returns!<EOP>
By the way, this secret entrance might be useful some day.
Don't forget about it!

[caption #63]
King: You mean, this young woman is_?!

[caption #64]
<A0>: Who do you think you are?

[caption #65]
King: Oh_my apologies!

[caption #66]
King: How rude of me to turn my back to a lady!

[caption #67]
The young king of Figaro Castle, ally to the Empire, and a master designer of machinery_

[caption #68]
<A4>: I am <A4>, king of Figaro.

[caption #69]
<A1>: Heh_ Surprised someone like me knows a king?

[caption #70]
<A1>: Well, talk to you two later!

[caption #71]
<A4>: So_you're an Imperial soldier, right? No problem. Figaro and the Empire are allies.<EOP>
Please, relax while you're here. It's not in my blood to harm a lady.

[caption #72]
<A0>: Look, why are you being so kind to me? Is it because of my_abilities?

[caption #73]
<A4>: I'll give you 3 reasons:
First of all, your beauty has captivated me!<EOP>
Second_I'm dying to know if I'm your type_

[caption #74]
I guess your_abilities_would be a distant third.

[caption #75]
<A0>: __? <D>
What is with you, anyway?

[caption #76]
<A4>: Guess my technique's getting a bit rusty_

[caption #77]
<A4>: Come find me when you feel rested.

[caption #78]
<A0>: Hmm_I suppose a normal girl would have found him dashing. <D>
But I'm hardly_normal_

[caption #79]
Feel free to wander about.

[caption #80]
Go see the King!

[caption #81]
Weapons and items manufactured here are sent to South Figaro. 

[caption #82]
Long ago, a force called [magic] existed.<EOP>
People who used magic were called [Mage Warriors.]

[caption #83]
Scholars the world over are doing research on magic.
What a waste of time_

[caption #84]
Ancient texts I'm studying speak of a [1000 year-old city beneath the sand.]<EOP>
I wonder what this means, <EOP>
[_when the queen stands and takes five steps foward_]

[caption #85]
I heard the Empire has revived the power of [magic]_

[caption #86]
The Empire has smashed the three cities on the southern continent. Just a matter of time 'til they come up here_

[caption #87]
Gestahl has harnessed the power of magic. Who can stop him now?!

[caption #88]
Though <A4> showers his attentions on women, most are too smart to pay any attention to him.

[caption #89]
His highness said he'd marry me when I get older!

[caption #90]
I wanna marry the king!

[caption #91]
He's always interrupting the High Priestess during important lectures to hit on her!<EOP>
Surely, he's_talked to you?

These thieves have been terrorizing the kingdom. Stay away from 'em!

[caption #97]
I demand to see <A4>!
How dare they keep us in this stinking pit!

[caption #98]
Hey! Let us outta here!

[caption #99]
Relax, they're just blowing off steam. But I'm telling you, there's no sense keeping us here!<EOP>
We're just small potatoes compared to the real threat lurking out there! And King <A4> knows it!

[caption #100]
I'm Lone Wolf, the pickpocket!

[caption #101]
High Priestess: <A4>'s at it again?! He hits on anything that moves!

[caption #102]
High Priestess: <A4> has a twin brother. He was such a nice boy, always thinking of his family_

[caption #103]
Youth: Brother, what's wrong with father? What's all this talk of his successor?<EOP>
<A4>: Are you blind? Look how thin his face has become!

[caption #104]
Youth: ?__What do you mean?

[caption #105]
Youth: Brother!

[caption #106]
Youth: You're crying__?!

[caption #107]
<A4>'s twin brother, who traded the throne for his own freedom_

[caption #108]
High Priestess: Ah, yes_
His name is <A5>. Oh, he looked so like his father!<EOP>
When he ran away, he was a sweet little child. I wonder what he's like now?

[caption #109]
Chancellor: The whole business of the succession was so repugnant to <A5>, the King's brother, that__<EOP>
__he fled the castle forever. The succession was settled with a coin toss_

[caption #110]
Merchant: I can't take money from the King!<EOP>
<A4>: Look, don't you have a family?
Just shut up and take it.

[caption #111]
Merchant: Sir <A5>, I can't take your money!<EOP>
<A5>: Take it! Haven't you heard? 
My brother says I'm a notorious spendthrift!

[caption #112]
<A4>: You've been busy down south!
Looking for more cities to destroy?<EOP>
Soldier: That's none of your concern!

[caption #113]
Sir Kefka?! What on earth do_<EOP>
Kefka: Outta my way!

[caption #114]
<A4>: Well? How do you like my castle?

[caption #115]
King <A4>! Someone from the Empire is here to see you!

[caption #116]
<A4>: Probably Kefka!

[caption #117]
Kefka: Phooey!
Emperor Gestahl's stupid orders!

[caption #118]
Kefka: <A4>, you pinhead!
Why do you have to live in the middle of the stinking desert?<EOP>
These recon jobs are the pits!

[caption #119]
Kefka: Ahem_there's SAND on my boots!

[caption #120]
Soldiers: Yes, Sir!
All set, Sir!

[caption #121]
Kefka: Idiots!

[caption #122]
<A4>: I thought we were allies! What are you doing in my domain?
Soldier: Allies? With this pathetic little country? HA!

[caption #123]
<A4>: What brings Kefka, loyal servant of Emperor Gestahl, to my humble castle?<EOP>
Kefka: A girl of no importance recently escaped from us. We heard she found refuge here_

[caption #124]
<A4>: Hmm_this wouldn't have anything to do with this [witch] everyone's been whispering about, would it?<EOP>
Kefka: Lies! She_merely stole something of minor value.
Is she here?

[caption #125]
<A4>: That's a tough one!

[caption #126]
<A4>: You see, there're more girls here than grains of sand out there. I can't keep track of 'em all!<EOP>
Kefka: I'd hate to be you if we find out you're lying_ Mwa, ha!

[caption #127]
Kefka: I truly hope nothing happens to your precious Figaro_!

[caption #128]
<A1>: I'd say that guy's missing a few buttons_<EOP>
<A4>: _Where's <A0>?

[caption #129]
<A4>: Take her to her room_

[caption #130]
<A4>: I'd love to chat with you, but the Chancellor and I must plan our strategy.<EOP>
It's hard being a king sometimes!
If you'll excuse me.

[caption #131]
<A1>: Follow me.

[caption #132]
<A1>: Don't you worry 'bout a thing! I'll_<EOP>
<A0>: You're <A1>, right? <A4> told me about you. Is it true you're a thief?

[caption #133]
<A1>: That's TREASURE HUNTER!

[caption #134]
<A1>: On the surface, <A4> pretends to support the Empire.<EOP>
The truth is, he's collaborating with the Returners, an organization opposed to the Empire.<EOP>
I am his contact with that group_

[caption #135]
<A1>: The old man you met in Narshe is one of us.<EOP>
<A0>: Empire_but I'm a soldier of the Empire_!

[caption #136]
<A1>: Not anymore! They were using you! Things are different now.

[caption #137]
<A0>: It's just_ I don't know what I should do. Whenever I try to think, my head hurts even worse_

[caption #138]
<A1>: I can't tell you what to do.<EOP>
You don't have to decide right now.
You'll soon find your way_

[caption #139]
<A0>: But how will I know which choice is right_?

[caption #140]
<A4>: _?<EOP>
What the hell?!

[caption #141]
<A4>: What's happening?<EOP>
Soldier: It's the Empire! It's Kefka!

[caption #142]
<A4>: What are you doing?

[caption #143]
Kefka: Bring me the girl. Now!
<A4>: I don't know what you're talking about!<EOP>
Kefka: Then_

Soldier: Yes, Sir!

[caption #147]
Kefka: Changed your mind_?

[caption #148]
<A4>: I guess I have no choice_

[caption #149]
<A4>: Or maybe I do!

[caption #150]
Kefka: Ackk! So, the brave and noble king flees, leaving his people behind!<EOP>
How utterly delightful! Hee-hee-hee!

[caption #151]

Kefka: Go! KILL THEM!

[caption #158]
Kefka: Son of a submariner!
They'll pay for this_

[caption #159]
<A1>: This is great! <E$06><OP$12>

[caption #160]
<A0>: Was that an evil person? <E$04><OP$12>
I_ <D>I'm scared_

[caption #161]
<A4>: <A0>, there's someone I'd like you to meet_

[caption #162]
<A1>: We're members of the Returners.<EOP>
<A4>: Our leader, Banon, would certainly like to meet you.<EOP>
[Magic] is going to be the key to winning this war.

[caption #163]
<A0>: [Magic]_

[caption #164]
<A4>: <A0> has magical powers. That Esper seemed to_react to her. Can there be some connection?<EOP>
<A0>: I haven't the foggiest! It just seems natural to me that I have the use of this power_

[caption #165]
<A4>: But no HUMAN is born with the powers you seem to have, and_

[caption #166]
<A4>: I apologize.
<A0>: What should I do_?<EOP>
<A4>: I'm sure the Empire is going to come after you_<EOP>
If they get their hands on you again, the world's finished_<EOP>
<A0>, you want to understand your own powers, right?

[caption #167]
<A4>: Then I think we need to consult with Banon. He will help you find the truth.<EOP>
<A0>: __

[caption #168]
<A1>: Please_

[caption #169]
<A4>: OK! To the south there's a cave that leads to South Figaro.

[caption #170]
This cave leads to South Figaro. It's closed now due to construction.

[caption #171]
Soldier: King <A4>! Where are you headed?<EOP>
<A4>: Through the cave, and eastward to South Figaro.<EOP>
<A4>: Return to the castle, and tell the others we're safe.<EOP>
Soldier: Yes, your majesty! Take care!

Welcome to South Figaro!

[caption #179]
You'll find lots of excellent weapons, armor and relics in our shops.

[caption #180]
Did you hear? Figaro Castle sank into the sand!<EOP>
You couldn't find it even if you knew where to look!

[caption #181]
Mt. Kolts is to the east.

[caption #182]
Beyond Mt. Kolts you'll find the Saber mountain range.

[caption #183]
Equip relics to gain a variety of abilities!<EOP>
For instance, these double my walking speed!

[caption #184]
My husband, Duncan, is a world-famous martial artist!<EOP>
He's taking his disciples to Mt. Kolts for meditation and training.

[caption #185]
<A5>, where's Vargas? Where's my husband?

[caption #186]
<A5>: Master was_
Vargas_

Duncan's Wife: I'll never understand Vargas_<EOP>
Fortunately, my husband taught his most secret techniques to you.

[caption #188]
<A5>: For 10 years you've treated me like a son. I am eternally grateful!

[caption #189]
__

[caption #190]
<A1>: At the very least you could give me a response_

[caption #191]
<A4>: Stand back! 
He seems vaguely familiar_
Wait a minute_!

[caption #192]
He owes allegiance to no one, 
and will do anything for money.
He comes and goes like the wind_

[caption #193]
<A4>: That's <A3>_! He'd slit his mama's throat for a nickel!

[caption #194]
<A1>: Better steer clear of him, I guess.

[caption #195]
<A3>: Leave us. The dog eats strangers_

[caption #196]
The guy at the counter_ He's kinda creepy_

[caption #197]
That guy at the counter_HEY! Where'd he go?

[caption #198]
Duncan's students have no peers!

[caption #199]
I'm so sorry to hear about Duncan.

[caption #200]
Duncan made his son, Vargas, practice a strict martial arts lifestyle. Vargas resented it.

[caption #201]
The house in the northern part of town belongs to our wealthiest citizen.

[caption #202]
The Empire's been invading one town after another. I don't think even South Figaro is safe!

[caption #203]
The Empire attacked Figaro Castle?!<EOP>
Now we'll all be drawn into the battle!

[caption #204]
I can't believe it! The Empire'll smash us!

[caption #205]
This town'll go down fighting! Even with their Magitek Armor, we'll make it tough on 'em!

[caption #206]
Attack the town from the east.
That way, <D>__?!<EOP>
Hey! Whaddaya think you're doin'? Barging in here while I'm trying to write a letter! Harumph!

Wind the clock! Wind the clock!<EOP>
Uh, that was just a jump-rope rhyme!

[caption #212]
Has war really begun? I'd better return to my home town_

[caption #213]
The Imperial Troops have turned this house into their headquarters.

[caption #214]
There's always a nasty draft in this room. Where's it coming from?

[caption #215]
I don't like strangers. Bring me some rum, and maybe I'll talk to you.

[caption #216]
What?! No rum?!

Hurumph_DOG!

Ah, Rum! Glug, glug, _<EOP>

[caption #219]
Go downstairs and give my grandson the password. It's_uh, umm_ I forget!

My grandfather once was a servant for the richest man in town.

Only merchants may pass through.

You're a merchant, right?
You may proceed.

[caption #223]

I heard Duncan's son, Vargas, is missing as well. I have a bad feeling about this_

All that was left in the box was a single ray of light: Hope.

Besides, I'm sure there are people who feel YOU'RE important to them! They are counting on you_

[caption #301]

If we push you too hard, we're no different than the Empire_<EOP>
So we want you to make up your own mind.

Banon: What're we going to do?<EOP>
<A4>: We'll escape down the Lete River, and make our way to Narshe. I want to see that Esper for myself_<EOP>
Banon: Right. There's a raft by the back entrance. It's a gamble, but we're fresh out of options_

[caption #331]
<A4>: You're in danger here. Come with us to Narshe.<EOP>
You'll probably even gain some understanding of your own abilities_

[caption #332]
Banon: We've no time to dilly-dally. Let's make for Narshe!

We'll handle things here_ Please leave for Narshe!

Give our regards to Banon.

The Lete River runs through some underground caverns.

[caption #336]
Banon: We all know that the Empire is using Magitek power in battle. The point is, how has the Emperor created it?

[caption #337]
<A4>: I had <A1> look into the rumor that the Empire is forcing the world's finest scholars to study Espers.

[caption #338]
<A1>: All the trouble in Narshe is over an Esper, too_

[caption #339]
Banon: Right_

[caption #340]
<A0>: You mean there's some connection between Espers and Magitek?<EOP>
Banon: I can only recall one thing linking Espers with Magitek power_

[caption #341]
<A4>: You don't mean_<EOP>
Banon: Indeed! The ancient War of the Magi_

[caption #342]
[No!]
[It can't be!]

[caption #343]
<A1>: My Grandma used to tell me bedtime stories about magical machines_ Could they have been true?

[caption #344]
<A4>: Could that ancient tragedy be playing out once again_<EOP>
Banon: It's just speculation_<EOP>
But historical studies have provided a number of conflicting and frightening theories_<EOP>
According to one theory, humans and machines were imbued with powers drained from Espers_

[caption #345]
<A0>: That could explain what Magitek power is_

[caption #346]
<A4>: So the only way to fight the Empire is fighting with Magitek ourselves_<EOP>
Banon: No! That's how the War of the Magi is said to have started!
<A4>: Then what do we do?

[caption #347]
Banon: It's risky, but if we have <A0>_speak with that Esper, it might just wake up_<EOP>
<A4>: I wonder if that's wise_

[caption #348]
Banon: Who can say? Regardless, we need <A0>'s help.

[caption #349]
<A1>: <A0>_

[caption #350]

Then along came the War of the Magi_

War of the Magi_

[caption #1096]
Ramuh: It took place_long ago. Espers fought humans who were infused with magical power extracted from Espers_

[caption #1097]
Fearing our magical powers would once again become a target, we fashioned a new realm, and moved there.

[caption #1098]
About 20 years ago, humans stumbled upon it_humans who knew about Espers, and the secrets to our powers. <E$18><OP$12>

[caption #1099]
Thus began a hunt for Espers. Only in this way could Emperor Gestahl create his invincible army. <E$18><OP$12>

[caption #1100]
In response to this, we erected a doorway, and threw the humans out.

Ramuh: Her very existence strikes fear into her own heart.

[How can we help her?]

[caption #1108]
Ramuh: When she accepts this aspect of herself, I think she'll be all right.

[We have to do something!]<EOP>
Ramuh: Then free those of my kind imprisoned in Gestahl's Magitek Research Facility. One of them can surely help her.

[What do you mean?]

Ramuh: Gestahl's methods are incorrect. You can't drain a live Esper of all its power.<EOP>
It is only when we are reduced to Magicite that our abilities can be transferred in total_

[caption #1117]
[Pardon?!]<EOP>
Ramuh: When we transform into Magicite, our power can be relocated.
[Magicite_?!]<EOP>
Ramuh: That's what's left of us when we_pass away.

Ramuh: These are my comrades who fell while escaping the Empire. And I will give you my power, as well_

Banon: Oh, you're here! The people of Narshe have finally decided to battle the Empire.<EOP>
How did it go at Vector_?

Arvis: I see_ Your plan would combine Narshe's resources with Figaro's machinery to storm the Empire_<EOP>
not enough manpower, though_

Banon: We have to open the sealed gate_

Arvis: We'll never beat the Empire without them.

Banon: When the gate has been opened, the Espers can attack from the east.<EOP>
We'll storm in at the same time, from the north.

[caption #1618]
Banon: We MUST get the Espers to understand.<EOP>
We have to establish a bond of trust between humans and Espers. Only one person can do this_

Half human, half Esper_ My mere existence is proof that such a bond CAN exist_

Cid: Humans shouldn't have searched for such power_

Their power is too great. Unless they're stopped, they'll rip the world asunder!

Gestahl: After the Espers went on their rampage, I knew I couldn't go on with my war.<EOP>
I asked myself why I had started it in the first place. By the way_<EOP>
About those questions you asked me_which did you ask first?

[caption #1807]
Gestahl: After they devastated my Empire, the Espers flew north, toward Triangle Island.<EOP>
We have no way of knowing when they'll decide to go on another rampage. <EOP>
We need to find them and convince them to set aside their aggression before that happens.<EOP>
After all that the Empire has put them through, I doubt they'd even listen to us.<EOP>

<C> What's done is done_
<C> That was inexcusable.
<C> Apologize again!!

Cid: But it could really make at least twice as fast_!

<A9>: Actually, when I was young there was something I was mad about_

[caption #1883]
<A0>: _huh?

[caption #1884]
<A9>: In my youth I dreamed of having the world's fastest airship, and fly it across the open sky_

[caption #1885]
<A0>: What changed__?<EOP>
<A9>: At that time there was a person who piloted the Falcon, the fastest vessel ever made.<EOP>
Sometimes we were the worst of rivals_but other times we were the best of friends.<EOP>
We always egged each other on to go faster and higher. When she disappeared along with her ship_<EOP>
I felt like I lost my spirit.

Have you talked to old man <A7>? Do so, and the inn keeper may be more reasonable.

<A8>: Thank you_

[caption #2008]
<A7>: I guess our town's little secret is out now_

[caption #2009]
<A1>: Can everyone here use magic? What's going on here?

[caption #2010]
<A7>: This is_
<D>_the village of the Mage Warriors_

[caption #2011]
<A7>: Long ago humans used Magicite to gain magical powers. They came to be known as Mage Warriors.

[caption #2012]
<A1>: But I thought they perished centuries ago_

[caption #2013]
<A7>: After the War of the Magi, the Espers fled to their new world behind the sealed gate.<EOP>
They wished to live peacefully, without fear of being used by humans. They left us here to fend for ourselves_<EOP>
But we were despised by normal people. Everyone felt we had begun that war_

[caption #2014]
<A7>: They sent people to hunt us down like animals. There weren't even any trials_<EOP>
<A0>: Even though the only difference was that you could use magic_?

[caption #2015]
<A7>: A few Mage Warriors escaped and found their way here. They were our ancestors.<EOP>
Our power of magic thinned through the bloodlines over time, but some of it remains.

[caption #2016]
<A0>: Look, if you're up to it, we could use your help. <D><EOP>
<A7>: So, you're after the Espers, eh_?

[caption #2017]
<A7>: Well, I owe you for saving <A8>. <D>I'll help you find your Espers.

[caption #2018]
<A8>: Me too! <D>
<A7>: I don't think so.

[caption #2019]
<A8>: What a fuddy-duddy_

[caption #2020]
<A1>: But_where do we start looking?<EOP>
<A7>: Hmm_
<D>If they're here, they must be hiding in the mountains to the west.

[caption #2021]
<A1>: Why there?
<A7>: Those mountains have powerful magical properties.<EOP>
They say the Espers consider it holy ground_

[caption #2022]
<A0>: Maybe they're drawn to that place, when running wild?

[caption #2023]
<A1>: I think it's worth a look.

[caption #2024]
<A3>: Don't take it the wrong way. I just wanted my dog back.

[caption #2025]
<A1>: Going somewhere?
<A3>: I'll search for the Espers in my own way.

[caption #2026]
Ultros: G'heh, heh_these statues of the Warring Triad are all mine!
These'll get Siegfried's attention!

<A7>: G_GRAMPS?!

<A0>: I suppose it wouldn't hurt to have you along_

[caption #2031]
<A7>: I can't believe it_
<D>The Statues of the Warring Triad!
<A0>: The [Warring Triad]?!

[caption #2032]
The birth of magic_<EOP>
3 gods were banished here. In time they began quarreling, which led to an all-out war.<EOP>
Those unlucky humans who got in the way were transformed into Espers, and used as living war machines_

[caption #2033]
<A1>: So they're stone. Faint letters are carved on the back of them_

[caption #2034]
<A1>: Say, old man, what exactly is the Warring Triad?

[caption #2035]
<A7>: According to legend, long ago the three gods brought the power of magic into this world.<EOP>
<A1>: So, they're the gods of magic, then?
<A7>: You could say that.

[caption #2036]
<A0>: I can feel their power_
<A7>: The Warring Triad are the source of all magic.<EOP>
It's said the Espers made these images of their creators, and put them in their holy ground.<EOP>
These represent power beyond all comprehension_

[caption #2037]
<A0>: Our Espers no doubt came to this island to bask in all this magical power!

[caption #2038]
After centuries of fighting one another, the three realized they accomplihed nothing.<EOP>
In a rare moment of mutual clarity, they agreed to seal themselves away from the world.<EOP>
With their last ounce of energy they gave the Espers back their own free will_ <EOP>
 _and then transformed themselves into stone. <EOP>
Their only request was that the Espers keep them sealed away for all eternity.

[caption #2039]
The Espers created these statues as a symbol of their vow to let the Warring Triad sleep in peace.<EOP>
The Espers have sworn to keep the gods' power from being abused.

[caption #2040]
<A1>: Phew_what a story.<EOP>
<A0>: If the Espers were attracted here by these statues, they must be around here somewhere!

[caption #2041]
<A1>: Say, old timer, what happened to the Warring Triad?<EOP>
<A7>: Legend has it that they're hidden somewhere beyond the reach of humans.<EOP>
I'd say they're beyond the sealed gate_

[caption #2042]
<A0>: I wonder if the barrier that protects that place is generated by the three gods?

[caption #2043]
<A8>: This is_an Esper?!

[caption #2044]
<A0>: There are so many_ <D><EOP>
<A1>: Gramps, take <A8> and clear outta here!

[caption #2045]
<A7>: Where'd they all come from?

[caption #2046]
Yura: Halt!

[caption #2047]
<A8>: What is it?
<A7>: I sense some immense magical power in <A0>_ <D>It_frightens me_

[caption #2048]
<A1>: I wonder if she's gonna go ballistic again?!

[caption #2049]
Yura: You're somehow different_
<D>I sense a familiar power radiating from you_<EOP>
<A0>: Yes.

[caption #2050]
<A7>: You're the Espers that fled through the sealed gate?<EOP>
Yura: As a rule, we are not allowed to visit to your world.<EOP>
We few had gathered near the gate, and were wondering how we could save the Espers that had been kidnapped.<EOP>
It was just a coincidence that <A0> appeared when she did_

[caption #2051]
<A0>: I felt_
your presence_
through the gate.<EOP>
Yura: We bolted the moment <A0> opened the gate. But once in your world, we lost control of our powers.

[caption #2052]
Yura: We completely leveled a city_and took some innocent lives_

[caption #2053]
<A0>: That's what happened to me! I lost all control of my power_

[caption #2054]
<A7>: There must be something in your world that allows you to focus your power differently.<EOP>
You must use caution while in our world_

[caption #2055]
Yura: We are deeply sorry to have caused you humans such suffering and pain.

[caption #2056]
<A1>: The past is history. The Empire seems to want to talk peace with you. Why not come with us?<EOP>
Yura: They would forgive us so easily?

[caption #2057]
<A1>: Let's go to Thamasa and talk with General Leo.
<A0>: Right!

[caption #2058]
<A1>: General Leo.<EOP>
Leo: <A1>_you're back! And you've made the Espers agree to meet with us!

Leo: I am General Leo. May I have your name, please?
Yura: I am called Yura.

Yura: We have done something inexcusable to your people.<EOP>
Yura: This probably isn't the time or place to ask for your forgiveness, but_

[caption #2061]
Leo: Speak no further. It is we who owe you an apology. We hungered for your power_<EOP>
How close we came to reenacting the War of the Magi!!!<EOP>
Yura: We must put this all behind us.

Anyone who opposes Kefka is doomed. He uses his [Light of Judgment] from high atop his tower to burn whole towns.

I saw it! Kefka used a light beam to burn the village of Mobliz, far to the east.<EOP>
Most of the adults there died trying to save their children_

The [Serpent Trench] used to be deep under water. Now it's above sea level.<EOP>

Many monsters nowadays attack with [Zombie], [Petrify] and the like. Have you equipped suitable Relics?

To the east you'll find the [Serpent Trench.] Further east you'll find the village of Mobliz.<EOP>
Boy, the Light of Judgment really fried that town_

The thieves are hanging out at the Pub. They all escaped from Figaro Castle.

[caption #2326]
The road you followed here used to be submerged underwater.

[caption #2327]
After the end of the world, I awoke all alone in Doma Castle.<EOP>
When I would try to sleep there, demons would come for me_ Oh! I don't want to remember that!

[caption #2328]
While traveling under the desert, Figaro Castle hit an obstacle and came to a halt.

[caption #2329]

     Received the Magicite

Gerad: Oh, yeah, you know how to get into Figaro Castle, don't you?!<EOP>
Henchman: G'ho ho, do we ever!

Gerad: Yeah, you lead the way since it's buried.

[caption #2334]
I understand they escaped from Figaro Castle's prison.

[caption #2335]
From out of nowhere a bunch of huge sandworms burrowed into the prison!<EOP>
We followed their tunnels back to the surface and escaped.

[caption #2336]
Our last boss perished that day. We met up with Gerad in this town.

[caption #2337]
The boss wants to sneak into Figaro Castle. He wants to get the booty from the storage room there.

[caption #2338]
We'll enter da castle through a secret cave dat only we knows about!

[caption #2348]
Figaro Castle disappeared the day the world became_

Figaro Castle had an accident under the desert.
Don't know what happened to its people_

[caption #2350]
That sweet little girl stopped coming around right after the world ended_

[caption #2351]
I'm so relieved the Empire's finally outta here!

[caption #2352]
Now all these thieves are demanding all our time.
Phew_I'm exhausted.

Gerad: You still here?!

[caption #2361]
We're storming Figaro Castle! That treasure is rightfully ours!

We won't stop 'till we get those treasures back!

[caption #2363]
We mustn't rest now! We have to start rebuilding!

[caption #2364]
We may be thieves, but at least we have goals in life!

[caption #2365]
For each life lost, a new one arrives to fill the void!<EOP>
Okay! Nothing's gonna stop us!

[caption #2366]
Oh_! That person!

Whoa! Am I dizzy!

If the [Light of Judgment] should burn our town down 100 times, we'll rebuild it 101 times!

[caption #2369]
Did you hear that Duncan's alive? His wife thinks so!

[caption #2370]
Some guy came through here a little while ago looking for some secret treasure.

The boss of these thieves is on the second floor.

I wanted to help, but didn't know where to look.<EOP>
Then I heard that those idiots had escaped from the prison.<EOP>
<A6>: You needed to use them_<EOP>
<A4>: Bingo. And I obviously couldn't let them find out I was the King of Figaro_<EOP>
<A6>: _considering that you threw most of 'em in jail to begin with!

Soldiers in the largest wing of the 
Empire's army can be broken down 
into five ranks, each distinguished 
by their armor color.<EOP>
Cadets are the lowest rank, 
wearing green armor and 
performing the most menial duties.<EOP>
Brown-armored soldiers, the largest 
portion of the Empire's forces, 
contain Soldiers, Commanders, 
Corporals, and Sergeants.<EOP>
Field Commanders wear black 
armor, and lead troops in combat. 
Should a field commander fall in 
battle, their formation will retreat.<EOP>
Orange-armored soldiers are under 
the direct command of Kefka 
Palazzo, and are all expertly trained 
in the piloting of Magitek Armor.<EOP>
The highest rank, wearing custom
armor, is the Imperial Elite. 
They are subdivided into Officers, 
Captains, Generals, and Templars.

20 years ago, Narshe placed a ban 
on coal exports to the invading 
Gestahlian Empire through armed 
resistance.<EOP>
While a pact for mutual peace was 
agreed upon, I can't help but 
wonder what their next steps will 
be.<EOP>
The recent excavation of the 
frozen esper only complicates 
things. How long before the pact 
is broken?
